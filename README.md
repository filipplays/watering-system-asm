# Watering system in ARM assembly

For my bachelor's thesis, I wrote about software optimization for embedded systems. In the text, I compared a C program compiled with the optimization for size (-Os) and the same program written in ARM assembly.

The "stm_number_one_in_only_assembly" folder contains the assembly program, and the "assembly_number_one" folder contains the C program. They are both the same program for a watering system. The watering system is just the Miško3 platform, where I am simulating a watering system. Miško3 is a learning platform created by a student at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Ljubljana. You can find its GitHub page here: https://github.com/mjankovec/MiSKo3.
